# Mario Kart 64 World Records

Today's TidyTuesday for Mario Kart 64. 

Not all tracks have had shortcuts figured out or used for world records so the legend is a bit messy due to this. I was just doing a quick visualisation with boxplot and jitter to plot the data. 

However, can be seen that rainbow road timings have lessen overall with shortcuts used.
