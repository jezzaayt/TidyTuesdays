## Animal Rescues in London
I focused looking at 2021 and 2020 due to seeing animal rescues during the pandemic times. 

Data went up to end of May for 2021, a month short of half a year and for cats that is just under half. Number of cats could be similar in the past two years. 


Most surprising animal to be rescued is a hamster for me as they are small, so it is not something I would expect.

I did change the names of animals e.g. Budgie to Bird and Pigdeon to Bird to keep them all in one category. As well as cat to Cat.
