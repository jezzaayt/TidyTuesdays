# Tidy Tuesday - Paralypmics

https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-08-03

I looked at differences in medals by countries and also South Africa medals won vs medals won by former paralypmic Oscar Pistorius. I explored the latter to see if Oscar's winnings contributed majority to their medals but it does not seem that his winning of medals were a majority to their country's medals
