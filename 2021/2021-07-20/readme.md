# Drought Levels Tidy Tuesday 
By U.S Drought Monitor

I went to focus on Texas as biggest state and as I know it is mainly desert. I annontated the max and the min area percentage of the state in a drought but the None drought level has 8% at all times, so I am bit unsure about that. I used the annontate function I would have liked to do it more automatic than manually put each X/Y but geom_text package kept duplicating and then tried ggstatsplot and that wasn't giving what I was aiming for either.
