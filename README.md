# TidyTuesdays
Collection of when I have joined the TidyTuesday. 

I used some previous TidyTuesday datasets in my [#30DayChartChallenge](https://github.com/jezzaayt/30DayChartChallenge) that ran in April 2021. Before, I begun doing the TidyTuesdays when they release to improve my ability. 

As the classic saying/quote "the more you practice the better you get". This will help me practice and improve with a variety of data.
